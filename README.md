# EnigmaSave

EnigmaSave is an Enigma machine emulator which lets you save the settings of the machine inside a configuration file.

# Installation

Download either the Windows or Linux executable in [releases](https://github.com/kristiyanf/EnigmaSave/releases). For Windows simply open the executable file. For Linux open a terminal in the directory containing the executable file, and run it with `./EnigmaSave`.

# Usage

You can configure the Enigma machine settings through the config.ini file, or directly through the input prompts given by the program. The program reads the settings from the configuration file as long as it is in the same directory, meaning you can easily share your settings with someone by simply sending them your configuration file.
